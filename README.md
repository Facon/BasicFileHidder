Very basic file hider.

# Background
During late 2008, I was exploring how Peer To Mail (P2M and Durie were 2 applications) worked for files. Specifically how it was possible to bypass some file security checkings that email providers did to files.

Actually, one way that worked very well was hidding files inside low resolution images, the most simple way to achieve this was joining a file and image separated by a signature. This is of couse, the most basic level of steganography but was enough to be able to store hidden files in major email providers.
